<h1>Weather Application</h1>
This project marked my first foray into JavaScript and API calls, providing a wealth of learning opportunities:

<h3>JavaScript Fundamentals:</h3> I gained hands-on experience with JavaScript syntax and functionalities, including variables, functions, and asynchronous programming using async/await.

<h3>API Integration:</h3> Interacting with the OpenWeatherMap API taught me how to make GET requests, handle responses, and manipulate the DOM to display the fetched data effectively. Understanding how to structure API requests and interpret JSON responses was crucial to the projectâ€™s success.

<h3>Responsive Design:</h3> I explored CSS techniques to create a visually appealing and responsive layout that adapts to different screen sizes, enhancing the overall user experience.

This project not only solidified my foundational knowledge of JavaScript but also ignited my passion for web development and API-driven applications.
